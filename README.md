## Files Description
* img: Output images (.fig file)
* src: All the functions code (.m file)
* main_unpurt.m: The script to make a simulation without disturbance
* main_purt.m: The script to make a simulation with disturbance
* huatu.m: The script to draw all the pictures
* unpurt.mat: Saved output workspace after running main_unpurt.m
* purt.mat: Saved output workspace after running main_purt.m

## Download
You can download it directly or just clone it by using Git
```
git clone https://github.com/KudoSZhang/WIMM.git
```

## Usage
Firstly you should make sure that src folder is added to your working path in matlab. Then run main_unpurt.m and save the output workspace as unpurt.mat in the same directory with main_unpurt.m. Then run main_purt.m and save the output workspace as purt.mat in the same directory with main_purt.m. Lastly, run huatu.m to draw all the pictures.
